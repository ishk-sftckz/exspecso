# plan-one-shot

`plan-one-shot` is Antigravity-style planning and execution.

## What It Enforces

- planning artifacts first (`task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `walkthrough.md`)
- strict review gate before execution
- explicit trigger phrase: `Execute Plan`
- ordered execution with continuous task status updates

## Best For

- features that need clear implementation plans
- multi-step refactors where scope control matters
- teams that want predictable plan review before coding
